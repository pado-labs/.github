# PADO

PADO (**P**rivacy-preserving **A**uthenticated **D**ata **O**perators) is a cryptographic infrasturcture for user data portability. With cutting-edge techniques including secure multi-party computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), PADO is able to provide the authorized and authenticated user data for data-driven dApps with privacy guarantees. 

PADO always seeks a secure and compliant way to build the products with user-centric design for both end-users and developers.  

About PADO Labs: We are firm belivers in MPC and other advanced cryptography techniques.
